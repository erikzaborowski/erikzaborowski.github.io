New submissions,Particle collisions around static spherically symmetric black hole and rotating black hole in gravity's rainbow,"Deng Lin-fang,Zhang He-yao,Long Chao-yun",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"We extend the Banados-Silk-West effect to the static spherically symmetric black hole and rotating black hole in gravity's rainbow. Through systematic investigation that the effects of different rainbow functions on the center-of-mass energy of two test particles colliding outside the event horizon, we discussed the possibility of infinite center-of-mass energy Ecm and the corresponding motion parameters. By employing rainbow functions g0=g1=(1-E/EP)-1, infinite Ecm can be achieved through collisions occurring outside the event horizon, rather than being confined solely to collisions near the event horizon.",
New submissions,Gravitational Bounce from the Quantum Exclusion Principle,"Enrique Gaztanaga,K. Sravan Kumar,Swaraj Pradhan,Michael Gabler",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the fully relativistic spherical collapse model of a uniform distribution of mass $M$ with initial comoving radius $\chi_*$ and spatial curvature $k \equiv 1/\chi_k^2 \le 1/\chi_*^2$ representing an over-density or bounded perturbation within a larger background. Our model incorporates a perfect fluid with an evolving equation of state, $P = P(\rho)$, which asymptotically transitions from pressureless dust ($P = 0$) to a ground state characterized by a uniform, time-independent energy density $\rho_{\rm G}$. This transition is motivated by the quantum exclusion principle, which prevents singular collapse, as observed in supernova core-collapse explosions. We analytically demonstrate that this transition induces a gravitational bounce at a radius $R_{\rm B} = (8 \pi G \rho_{\rm G}/3)^{-1/2}$. The bounce leads to an exponential expansion phase, where $P(\rho)$ behaves effectively as an inflation potential. This model provides novel insights into black hole interiors and, when extended to a cosmological setting, predicts a small but non-zero closed spatial curvature: $ -0.07 \pm 0.02 \le \Omega_k < 0$. This lower bound follows from the requirement of $\chi_k \ge \chi_* \simeq 15.9$ Gpc to address the cosmic microwave background low quadrupole anomaly. The bounce remains confined within the initial gravitational radius $r_{\rm S} = 2GM$, which effectively acts as a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ inside $r_{\rm S}=\sqrt{3/\Lambda}$ while still appearing as a Schwarzschild black hole from an external perspective. This framework unifies the origin of inflation and dark energy, with its key observational signature being the presence of small but nonzero spatial curvature, a testable prediction for upcoming cosmological surveys.",

By carefully predicting the frequencies and amplitudes of black hole quasinormal modes and comparing them with gravitational-wave data from compact binary mergers we can advance our understanding of the two-body problem in general relativity, verify the predictions of the theory in the regime of strong and dynamical gravitational fields, and search for physics beyond the Standard Model or new gravitational degrees of freedom. We summarize the state of the art in our understanding of black hole quasinormal modes in general relativity and modified gravity, their excitation, and the modeling of ringdown waveforms. We also review the status of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA ringdown observations, data analysis techniques, and the bright prospects of the field in the era of LISA and next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.",
New submissions,How Many Times Should We Matched Filter Gravitational Wave Data? A Comparison of GstLAL's Online and Offline Performance,"Prathamesh Joshi,Wanting Niu,Chad Hanna,Rachael Huxford,Divya Singh,Leo Tsukada,Shomik Adhicary,Pratyusava Baral,Amanda Baylor,Kipp Cannon,Sarah Caudill,Michael W.

Data from every observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration is typically analyzed in this way twice, first in a low-latency mode in which gravitational wave candidates are identified in near-real time, and later in a high-latency mode. Such high-latency analyses have traditionally been considered more sensitive, since background data from the full observing run is available for assigning significance to all candidates, as well as more robust, since they do not need to worry about keeping up with live data. In this work, we present a novel technique to use the matched filtering data products from a low-latency analysis and re-process them by assigning significances in a high-latency way, effectively removing the need to perform matched filtering a second time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we analyze 38 days of LIGO and Virgo data from the third observing run (O3) using the GstLAL pipeline, and show that our method is as sensitive and reliable as a traditional high-latency analysis. Since matched filtering represents the vast majority of computing time for a traditional analysis, our method greatly reduces the time and computational burden required to produce the same results as a traditional high-latency analysis. Consequently, it has already been adopted by GstLAL for the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration.",
New submissions,Critical slowing down of black hole phase transition and kinetic crossover in supercritical regime,"Ran Li,Kun Zhang,Jiayue Yang,Robert B. Mann,Jin Wang",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter (RNAdS) black holes in the extended phase space exhibit critical behavior analogous to the liquid-gas system, with critical exponents matching those of van der Waals-type phase transitions. However, the kinetics of these transitions near spinodal and critical points remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that both the autocorrelation time and the variance of trajectories increase significantly as the system approaches these special points, signaling critical slowing down. This behavior is driven by the flattening of the free energy landscape, as further confirmed by the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker-Planck equation. Moreover, we uncover a clear dynamical crossover separating gas-like and liquid-like regimes in the supercritical region. This kinetic crossover defines the Widom line that closely matches the thermodynamic one obtained from the maxima of the isobaric heat capacity. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the kinetics of RNAdS black holes in the vicinity of spinodal and critical points.",
New submissions,Study of Curvature-Matter Coupling in Modified Gravity,Lakhan V. Jaybhaye,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Over the past century, General Relativity (GR) has been a cornerstone of gravitational theory. However, recent cosmological observations, such as the accelerated expansion of the Universe, challenge its completeness and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This has motivated the development of alternative approaches, including dynamical dark energy and modifications to gravity. This thesis investigates the $f(R, L_m)$ gravity framework, which extends $f(R)$ gravity by introducing curvature-matter coupling, to address unresolved issues in modern cosmology.Chapter 1 reviews the foundations of cosmology, GR, and $\Lambda$CDM, discussing their challenges and introducing modified gravity theories. Chapter 2 studies cosmic expansion in a specific non-linear $f(R, L_m)$ model, analyzing its dynamics using updated $H(z)$ and Pantheon datasets and demonstrating a deceleration-to-acceleration transition. Chapter 3 introduces a model-independent Hubble parameter parametrization and explores cosmological variables using MCMC and combined data. Chapter 4 incorporates bulk viscosity into $f(R, L_m)$ models to explain late-time acceleration and applies Om diagnostics and energy conditions. Chapter 5 examines non-singular matter bounce cosmologies, analyzing bouncing dynamics and the evolution of cosmographic parameters. Chapter 6 addresses gravitational baryogenesis and shows how $f(R, L_m)$ gravity supports the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Chapter 7 summarizes the results and suggests directions for future work.",
New submissions,Covariant diffusion and drift of the stochastic GW background with LISA,"Giorgio Mentasti,Arad Nasiri",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the covariant diffusion and drift of massless particles on the light cone within the context of quantum gravity phenomenology. Unlike modified dispersion relations that violate Lorentz invariance and grow with frequency, this model introduces a stochastic correction to the massless geodesic equation while preserving Lorentz invariance, and is dominant at lower frequencies due to the larger spacetime support of long-wavelength modes. The effect is phenomenologically described by just two diffusion and drift parameters, $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, whose values are already constrained by measurements of the CMB blackbody spectrum. We show that a direct measurement and characterization of a gravitational wave (GW) background frequency spectrum can improve bounds on these diffusion and drift parameters by over 12 orders of magnitude compared to those from the CMB. In particular, we find that detecting a GW background sourced by realistic models of first-order phase transitions or primordial black holes (PBH) with LISA can constrain the parameters down to a value of $\kappa_1,\,\kappa_2\lesssim 10^{-56}\,\text{kg}\,\text{m}^2\text{s}^{-3}$.",
New submissions,Likelihoods for Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Data Analysis,"Gabriele Franciolini,Mauro Pieroni,Angelo Ricciardone,Joseph D. Romano",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a systematic study of likelihood functions used for Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) searches. By dividing the data into many short segments, one customarily takes advantage of the Central Limit Theorem to justify a Gaussian crosscorrelation likelihood. We show, with a hierarchy of ever more realistic examples, beginning with a single frequency bin and one detector, and then moving to two and three detectors with white and colored signal and noise, that approximating the exact Whittle likelihood by various Gaussian alternatives can induce systematic biases in the estimation of the SGWB parameters. We derive several approximations for the full likelihood and identify regimes where Gaussianity breaks down. We also discuss the possibility of conditioning the full likelihood on fiducial noise estimates to produce unbiased SGWB parameter estimation. We show that for some segment durations and bandwidths, particularly in space-based and pulsar-timing arrays, the bias can exceed the statistical uncertainty. Our results provide practical guidance for segment choice, likelihood selection, and data-compression strategies to ensure robust SGWB inference in current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors.",
Cross submissions,Colloquium: The Cosmic Dipole Anomaly,"Nathan Secrest,Sebastian von Hausegger,Mohamed Rameez,Roya Mohayaee,Subir Sarkar",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The Cosmological Principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged on large scales), is the foundational assumption of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies such as the current standard Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. This simplification yields an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that relates space and time through a single time-dependent scale factor, which defines cosmological observables such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift. The validity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can now be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of radio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the expectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a perturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole agrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger, demonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear isotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy in at least one of them. This discrepancy now exceeds 5{\sigma} in significance. We review these recent findings, as well as the potential biases, systematic issues, and alternate interpretations that have been suggested to help alleviate the tension. We conclude that the cosmic dipole anomaly poses a serious challenge to FLRW cosmology, and the standard {\Lambda}CDM model in particular, as an adequate description of our Universe.",
Cross submissions,Can metric-affine gravity be saved?,"Will Barker,Carlo Marzo,Alessandro Santoni",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Like general relativity, metric-affine gravity should be a viable effective quantum theory, otherwise it is a mathematical curiosity without physical application. Assuming a perturbative quantum field theory, the universal, flat limit of metric-affine gravity offers a good foundation for model-building only when symmetry constraints are themselves sufficient to get rid of ghosts and tachyons, without requiring any further tuning of the couplings. Using this symmetry-first criterion, we find that for parity-preserving models with a totally symmetric distortion, only massless spin-one and spin-three modes are possible besides the graviton. Moreover, no viable models result from gauge symmetries generated by a scalar field.",
Cross submissions,Superfluid Dark Matter,"Lasha Berezhiani,Giordano Cintia,Valerio De Luca,Justin Khoury",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.",
Cross submissions,The analytical general solutions of power-law inflation,"Yao Yu,Hong-Song Xie,Bai-Cian Ke,Han Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Power-law inflation has stood as a classical model in inflationary cosmology since the early 1980s, prized for its exact analytical solutions and ability to naturally resolve the Big Bang theory's horizon and flatness problems through exponential expansion. However, its simplest form appears incompatible with modern precision observations, motivating increasingly complex alternatives. In this work, we demonstrate previous predictions with Power-law inflation considered only a particular solution of the field equations, and derive the complete set of general analytical solutions that satisfy current theoretical and observational constraints. This finding revitalizes Power-law inflation as a viable framework, offering new possibilities for cosmological model-building while preserving its original mathematical elegance.",
Cross submissions,Quantum Search for Gravitational Wave of Massive Black Hole Binaries,"Fangzhou Guo,Jibo He",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. In this work, a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm is applied to the MBHB signals. It is demonstrated that the quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. Simulated results indicate that the quantum-enhanced approach significantly reduces computational costs. However, it is also found that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. This highlights the need for more robust and stable quantum search strategies.",
Cross submissions,Sphere amplitudes and observing the universe's size,"Andreas Blommaert,Adam Levine",High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Sine dilaton gravity is holographically related to DSSYK. We explain how to interpret sine dilaton as 2d quantum cosmology. This paves the way for using two copies of DSSYK as hologram for Big-Bang cosmologies. We study the most basic cosmological observable: the sphere amplitude. Via canonical quantization we find a finite answer that matches the on-shell action of a dual matrix integral. The sphere amplitude (or the norm of the no-boundary wavefunction) also gives a prediction for the universe's size. In the context of slow-roll inflation, the no-boundary state is non-normalizable, and predicts a small universe, in contradiction with experiments. We argue that an avatar of these issues exists in dS JT gravity. By considering sine dilaton as a UV completion of dS JT gravity, the state becomes normalizable. We then consider the observer's no-boundary state and show that this prefers neither small nor large universes. The resulting distribution is flat.",
Cross submissions,The Quintom theory of dark energy after DESI DR2,"Yifu Cai,Xin Ren,Taotao Qiu,Mingzhe Li,Xinmin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Observations from DESI DR2 are challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by suggesting that the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy evolves across $w = -1$, a phenomenon known as the Quintom scenario. Inspired by this development, we present a staged review of Quintom cosmology including its theoretical foundations, observational supports, and implications as well as possible extensions. We first trace the historical progression from Einstein's static cosmological constant to modern dynamical dark energy, summarizing recent cosmological constraints that favor an evolving $w(z)$ along time. A key focus is the theoretical no-go theorem for dark energy showing that no single canonical field or perfect fluid model can smoothly cross the $w = -1$ boundary. We then survey viable Quintom constructions, including two-field models, single-scalar fields with higher derivatives, modified gravity frameworks, and an effective field theory approach that unifies these mechanisms. Possible interactions of Quintom fields with ordinary matter and the potential roles in yielding non-singular universe solutions are discussed.",
Cross submissions,What solves the Hubble tension in phenomenological dark energy models at background level?,Manosh T. Manoharan,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Few phenomenological models tend to favour higher values of the Hubble parameter, often at the expense of invoking phantom transitions. These models achieve this without introducing additional parameters, akin to the simplicity of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate two such models -- Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) and Granda-Oliveros Holographic Dark Energy (GOHDE) -- to assess how correlations between $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$, as well as the choice of datasets, influence conclusions regarding their potential to address the Hubble tension at the background level. We find that minimally extended versions of these models favour notably low values for the Hubble parameter, with the perceived preference for higher values driven by the associated prior. Excluding BAO Ly$\alpha$-$H(z)$ data points at a redshift of $\sim 2.3$ results in a Hubble parameter that remains in significant tension with SH0ES measurements. In contrast, including these data points favours a higher $H_0$, as they suggest a relatively lower matter density within the framework of the assumed fiducial cosmology. Additionally, recent DESI DR1 and DR2 data exhibit mild tension with BAO-$H(z)$ estimates from SDSS. We demonstrate that the inclusion of stringent constraints, such as the CMB shift-parameter along with Pantheon$^+$, on the effective pressure less matter density significantly impacts the estimation of the Hubble parameter. Finally, reinterpreting these models in terms of interacting dark sectors with $Q = 3H\gamma_{\Lambda}\tilde{\rho}_{m}$ reveals that addressing the Hubble tension necessitates a varying $\gamma_{\Lambda}$ characterised by a singular sign-switch behaviour. This phantom behaviour, or equivalently, the onset of violation of the null energy condition in the future, is crucial for minimal models to solve the Hubble tension.",
Cross submissions,The effects of the spin and quadrupole moment of SgrA* on the orbits of S stars,"K. Abd El Dayem,F. H. Vincent,G. Heissel,T. Paumard,G. Perrin",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Measuring the astrometric and spectroscopic data of stars orbiting the central black hole in our galaxy (Sgr A*) offers a promising way to measure relativistic effects. In principle, the ""no-hair"" theorem can be tested at the Galactic Center by monitoring the orbital precession of S-stars due to the angular momentum (spin) and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*. Closer-in stars, more strongly affected by the black hole's rotation, may be required. GRAVITY+ could detect such stars that are currently too faint for GRAVITY. We aim to analytically and numerically characterize orbital reorientations induced by spin-related effects of Sgr A* up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order. We use the two-timescale method to derive the 2PN analytical expressions of the secular evolution of the orbital parameters that are related to the observer. To study the interaction between the orbital and spin orientations, we introduce observer-independent quantities that offer insight into the Kerr geometry. We also use the post-Newtonian code OOGRE to simulate hypothetical stars orbiting closer to Sgr A*, where spin and quadrupole effects are stronger. This enables comparison with our analytical predictions. We exhibit three orbital-timescale precession rates that encode the in-plane pericenter shift and the out-of-plane redirection of the osculating ellipse. We provide the 2PN expressions of these precession rates and express the orbit-integrated associated angular shifts of the pericenter and of the ellipse axes. We relate these orbital-timescale precession rates to the secular-timescale precession of the orbital angular momentum around the black hole spin axis. We consider that the theoretical insight we provide in this article will be useful in constraining the spin effect of Sgr A* with GRAVITY+ observations.",
