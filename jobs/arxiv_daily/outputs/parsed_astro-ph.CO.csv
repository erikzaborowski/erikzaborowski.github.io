New submissions,Excess of substructure due to primordial black holes,"Patricio Colazo,Nelson Padilla,Federico Stasyszyn",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"This paper explores the impact of primordial black holes (PBHs) on the abundance of low-mass haloes and subhaloes in the dark and low-stellar-mass regime, and examines how these effects can be measured through fluctuations in strong lensing and brightness fluctuations in clusters of galaxies, providing potential ways to constrain the fraction of dark matter in PBHs. Various dark matter candidates leave unique imprints on the low-mass range of the halo mass function, which can be challenging to detect. Among these are hot and warm dark matter models, which predict a reduced abundance of low-mass structures compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Models with PBHs also affect this mass range, but in the opposite direction, producing an increase in low-mass objects. By examining lensing perturbations in galaxy clusters, constraints can be placed on the low-mass subhalo abundance and, therefore, on these different dark matter models. We aim to provide predictions useful for this type of perturbation in the PBH case. Additionally, we examine the abundance of haloes and subhaloes in the range where the stellar-to-halo mass relation rises steeply, which could be contrasted with brightness fluctuations in clusters caused by low-luminosity satellites. To do this, we run cosmological simulations using the {\small SWIFT} code, comparing a fiducial model with alternative inflationary models, both with and without PBHs. We find a significant excess of substructure in the presence of PBHs compared to $\Lambda$CDM, without altering the abundance of high-mass haloes at redshift zero. This increase reaches factors of $\sim6$ for extended PBH mass functions with exponential cutoffs at $M_{\rm PBH}=10^2M_\odot$ in the range of parameter space where they could make up all of the dark matter, and persists even for sub-percent PBH fractions with cutoffs at $M_{\rm PBH}=10^4M_\odot$.",
New submissions,Superfluid Dark Matter,"Lasha Berezhiani,Giordano Cintia,Valerio De Luca,Justin Khoury",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.",
New submissions,Cosmology with Topological Deep Learning,"Jun-Young Lee,Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The standard cosmological model with cold dark matter posits a hierarchical formation of structures. We introduce topological neural networks (TNNs), implemented as message-passing neural networks on higher-order structures, to effectively capture the topological information inherent in these hierarchies that traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to account for. Our approach not only considers the vertices and edges that comprise a graph but also extends to higher-order cells such as tetrahedra, clusters, and hyperedges. This enables message-passing between these heterogeneous structures within a combinatorial complex. Furthermore, our TNNs are designed to conserve the $E(3)$-invariance, which refers to the symmetry arising from invariance against translations, reflections, and rotations. When applied to the Quijote suite, our TNNs achieve a significant reduction in the mean squared error. Compared to our GNNs, which lack higher-order message-passing, ClusterTNNs show improvements of up to 22% in $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and 34% in $\sigma_8$ jointly, while the best FullTNN achieves an improvement of up to 60% in $\sigma_8$. In the context of the CAMELS suite, our models yield results comparable to the current GNN benchmark, albeit with a slight decrease in performance. We emphasize that our topology and symmetry-aware neural networks provide enhanced expressive power in modeling the large-scale structures of our universe.",
New submissions,The Impact of Galaxy Overdensities and Ionized Bubbles on Ly$Î±$ Emission $z\sim7.0\mbox{--}8.5$,"Zuyi Chen,Daniel P. Stark,Charlotte A. Mason,Mengtao Tang,Lily Whitler,Michael W. Topping",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy with {\it JWST} is opening a new window on the sizes of ionized bubbles through the reionization epoch. Theoretical expectations suggest typical bubble radii should be 0.6--1.5 pMpc at $z\simeq 7$, assuming neutral hydrogen fractions of the intergalactic medium in the range $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}$=0.5--0.7. Here we investigate this picture using {\it JWST} to characterize the environment and Ly$\alpha$ emission of 292 galaxies at $7.0<z<8.5$ across 5 fields spanning a comoving volume of $1.3\times10^6$ Mpc$^3$. If the reionization predictions are correct, we should see overdensities and strong Ly$\alpha$ emission clustered in redshift windows of d$z=0.04-0.08$ and angular scales of 5--11 arcmin. We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission in 36 out of 292 galaxies, including nine new Ly$\alpha$ detections, two of which (in the UDS field) show extremely large equivalent widths (EW = $200_{-78}^{+50}$ A and $284_{-75}^{+56}$ A). We identify 13 significant (4--11$\times$) galaxy overdensities using redshifts from NIRCam grism and NIRSpec. Strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters are almost uniformly found in the overdensities, with nearly all located between the center and back of the structures. The overdensities that host the strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters span typical line-of-sight distances (d$z\sim 0.14$) and angular scales ($\sim 8$ arcmin) that are comparable to the predicted bubble sizes at $z\simeq 7$. We discuss evidence that the EGS is mostly ionized along a 24 pMpc sightline at $z\simeq 7.0-7.6$, based on the presence of 3 overdense structures and 10 Ly$\alpha$ emitters in this volume, and find such a large ionized region would pose tension with standard reionization models.",
New submissions,The analytical general solutions of power-law inflation,"Yao Yu,Hong-Song Xie,Bai-Cian Ke,Han Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Power-law inflation has stood as a classical model in inflationary cosmology since the early 1980s, prized for its exact analytical solutions and ability to naturally resolve the Big Bang theory's horizon and flatness problems through exponential expansion. However, its simplest form appears incompatible with modern precision observations, motivating increasingly complex alternatives. In this work, we demonstrate previous predictions with Power-law inflation considered only a particular solution of the field equations, and derive the complete set of general analytical solutions that satisfy current theoretical and observational constraints. This finding revitalizes Power-law inflation as a viable framework, offering new possibilities for cosmological model-building while preserving its original mathematical elegance.",
New submissions,A new shock in the pre-merging cluster pair 1E2215-2216,"Yanling Chen,Liyi Gu,Aurora Simionescu,Chunyang Jiang,Rui Huang,Wei Cui",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The galaxy cluster pair 1E2216.0-0401 and 1E2215.7-0404 represents a major cluster merger in its early stages, a phase that has been scarcely explored in previous studies. Within this system, both axial and equatorial merger shocks have been identified. Recent XMM-Newton observations of the southern region of the cluster pair have increased the total exposure time to approximately 300 ks, enhancing the sensitivity to detect faint shock features in the cluster outskirts. Through a combined analysis of XMM-Newton and Chandra data, including both imaging and spectral techniques, a new shock front has been identified at approximately 2'.3 south of the X-ray brightness peak of 1E2215. This shock front exhibits a surface brightness ratio of $1.33 \pm 0.07$ and a temperature ratio of $1.22^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$ in XMM-Newton, consistent with Chandra results. The Mach number, independently calculated from both the temperature and surface brightness discontinuities, yields consistent values of $\mathcal{M} \approx 1.2$ . The age, velocity, and spatial distribution of this shock suggest that it shares a common physical origin with the previously identified equatorial shock.",
New submissions,Signatures of Fuzzy Dark Matter Inside Radial Critical Curves,"J. M. Palencia,Paloma Morilla,Sung Kei Li,J. M. Diego,Amruth Alfred,Thomas J. Broadhurst,B. J. Kavanagh,Jeremy Lim",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We investigate the strong gravitational lensing properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, focusing on the magnification properties near radial critical curves (CCs). Using simulated lenses we compute magnification maps for a range of axion masses and halo configurations. We show that FDM produces enhanced central magnification and secondary CCs that are not easily reproduced by standard cold dark matter (CDM), even when including subhalos. The strength and scale of these effects depend primarily on the de~Broglie wavelength, governed by the axion and halo masses. We find that axion masses in the range $m_\psi \sim 10^{-22}$--$10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$ in galaxy-mass halos lead to distinctive magnification distributions. Our results suggest that observations of highly magnified, compact sources near radial arcs, such as quasars or supernovae, could serve as a powerful test for the presence of FDM.",
New submissions,A White Paper on The Multi-Messenger Science Landscape in India,"Samsuzzaman Afroz,Sanjib Kumar Agarwalla,Dipankar Bhattacharya,Soumya Bhattacharya,Subir Bhattacharyya,Varun Bhalerao,Debanjan Bose,Chinmay Borwanker,Ishwara Chandra C.

Tendulkar,Gaurav Waratkar,Kuldeep Yadav",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph),"The multi-messenger science using different observational windows to the Universe such as Gravitational Waves (GWs), Electromagnetic Waves (EMs), Cosmic Rays (CRs), and Neutrinos offer an opportunity to study from the scale of a neutron star to cosmological scales over a large cosmic time. At the smallest scales, we can explore the structure of the neutron star and the different energetics involved in the transition of a pre-merger neutron star to a post-merger neutron star. This will open up a window to study the properties of matter in extreme conditions and a guaranteed discovery space. On the other hand, at the largest cosmological scales, multi-messenger observations allow us to study the long-standing problems in physical cosmology related to the Hubble constant, dark matter, and dark energy by mapping the expansion history of the Universe using GW sources. Moreover, the multi-messenger studies of astrophysical systems such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes of different masses, all the way up to a high redshift Universe, will bring insightful understanding into the physical processes associated with them that are inaccessible otherwise. This white paper discusses the key cases in the domain of multi-messenger astronomy and the role of observatories in India which can explore uncharted territories and open discovery spaces in different branches of physics ranging from nuclear physics to astrophysics.",
New submissions,Robust Evidence for Dynamical Dark Energy from DESI Galaxy-CMB Lensing Cross-Correlation and Geometric Probes,"Miguel A. Sabogal,Rafael C. Nunes",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Recent analyses joining data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) have provided strong evidence in favor of dynamical dark energy (DDE) over a simple cosmological constant. Motivated by these findings, we present new observational constraints on DDE based on the cross-correlation between DESI Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) samples and CMB lensing ($\mathrm{CMB}_{\kappa} \times \mathrm{LRG}$), which effectively probes the impact of cosmological parameters on the growth of structure at the perturbative level. We demonstrate that, when combined with geometric measurements such as BAO and SNIa, this cross-correlation yields compelling statistical evidence for DDE exceeding $4\sigma$, including within simpler parametrizations such as the $w$CDM model. Remarkably, this evidence is independent of constraints from primary Planck CMB anisotropies data. These results highlight the robustness and potential of Galaxy-CMB lensing cross-correlation as a powerful observational probe of the dark sector, particularly when used in conjunction with geometric observables.",
New submissions,Revisiting the temperature evolution law of the CMB with gaussian processes,"Felipe Avila,Alexander Bonilla Rivera,Rafael C. Nunes,R.F.L. Holanda,Armando Bernui",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we perform a statistical inference of the classical background law governing the evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), given by $T_{\rm CMB}(z) = T_0(1 + z)$. To this end, we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression techniques to reconstruct the temperature evolution based on two observational datasets: (i) CMB-Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster measurements and (ii) CMB-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction data. Our analysis reveals interesting results that may suggest potential deviations from the standard temperature-redshift relation, particularly at low redshifts ($z < 0.5$), where discrepancies up to $\sim$2$\sigma$ are observed. Additionally, we identify a mild but noteworthy tension, also at the $\sim$2$\sigma$ level, between our GP inferred value of the present-day CMB temperature, $T_{\rm CMB}(z=0)$, and the precise direct measurement from the COBE/FIRAS experiment. We also explore possible phenomenological implications of our findings, including interpretations associated with possible variations in fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, which could provide a physical explanation for the observed deviations at low redshift.",
New submissions,$Î´n$ formalism: A new formulation for the probability density of the curvature perturbation,"Diego Cruces,Shi Pi,Misao Sasaki",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"$\delta N$ formalism is a useful method to calculate the curvature perturbation. Contrary to what it is typically done in the literature, we re-formulate the $\delta N$ formalism by using the $e$-folding number $n$ counted forward in time. For a fixed initial time $\bar{n}_0$, the probability density function (PDF) of the initial conditions $\delta\phi_0$ and $\delta\pi_0$ are specified by the solutions of the perturbation equation on subhorizon scales. As $\delta\pi_0$ is fully correlated with $\delta\phi_0$ after horizon exit, we find a simple formula to calculate the curvature perturbation as well as its PDF by using the $\delta N$ method reformulated in terms of $n$, the $\delta n$ formalism.",
New submissions,The Quintom theory of dark energy after DESI DR2,"Yifu Cai,Xin Ren,Taotao Qiu,Mingzhe Li,Xinmin Zhang",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"Observations from DESI DR2 are challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by suggesting that the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy evolves across $w = -1$, a phenomenon known as the Quintom scenario. Inspired by this development, we present a staged review of Quintom cosmology including its theoretical foundations, observational supports, and implications as well as possible extensions. We first trace the historical progression from Einstein's static cosmological constant to modern dynamical dark energy, summarizing recent cosmological constraints that favor an evolving $w(z)$ along time. A key focus is the theoretical no-go theorem for dark energy showing that no single canonical field or perfect fluid model can smoothly cross the $w = -1$ boundary. We then survey viable Quintom constructions, including two-field models, single-scalar fields with higher derivatives, modified gravity frameworks, and an effective field theory approach that unifies these mechanisms. Possible interactions of Quintom fields with ordinary matter and the potential roles in yielding non-singular universe solutions are discussed.",
New submissions,What solves the Hubble tension in phenomenological dark energy models at background level?,Manosh T. Manoharan,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"Few phenomenological models tend to favour higher values of the Hubble parameter, often at the expense of invoking phantom transitions. These models achieve this without introducing additional parameters, akin to the simplicity of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate two such models -- Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) and Granda-Oliveros Holographic Dark Energy (GOHDE) -- to assess how correlations between $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$, as well as the choice of datasets, influence conclusions regarding their potential to address the Hubble tension at the background level. We find that minimally extended versions of these models favour notably low values for the Hubble parameter, with the perceived preference for higher values driven by the associated prior. Excluding BAO Ly$\alpha$-$H(z)$ data points at a redshift of $\sim 2.3$ results in a Hubble parameter that remains in significant tension with SH0ES measurements. In contrast, including these data points favours a higher $H_0$, as they suggest a relatively lower matter density within the framework of the assumed fiducial cosmology. Additionally, recent DESI DR1 and DR2 data exhibit mild tension with BAO-$H(z)$ estimates from SDSS. We demonstrate that the inclusion of stringent constraints, such as the CMB shift-parameter along with Pantheon$^+$, on the effective pressure less matter density significantly impacts the estimation of the Hubble parameter. Finally, reinterpreting these models in terms of interacting dark sectors with $Q = 3H\gamma_{\Lambda}\tilde{\rho}_{m}$ reveals that addressing the Hubble tension necessitates a varying $\gamma_{\Lambda}$ characterised by a singular sign-switch behaviour. This phantom behaviour, or equivalently, the onset of violation of the null energy condition in the future, is crucial for minimal models to solve the Hubble tension.",
New submissions,Accurate and efficient likelihood modeling for large-scale CMB data,"Giacomo Galloni,Paolo Campeti,Luca Pagano,Martina Gerbino,Massimiliano Lattanzi,Paolo Natoli",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Accurate parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data requires reliable likelihood modeling, particularly at large angular scales where angular power spectrum estimators exhibit non-Gaussian statistics. We present a novel approach, based on the Hamimeche-Lewis formalism, that marginalizes over auto-spectra, thus reducing residual biases from noise misestimation and partial sky coverage. We validate our approach by simulating three independent CMB channels, or data splits, in a multi-field setting, comparing to the pixel-based likelihood ground truth estimates for the optical depth $\tau$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We benchmark our method against the main power spectrum based alternatives available in the literature, showing that it outperforms all of them in terms of accuracy, while remaining fast and computationally efficient.",

Faisst,Richard M. Feder,Michael W. Werner",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We describe the SPHEREx Sky Simulator, a software tool designed to model science data for NASA's SPHEREx mission that will carry out a series of all-sky spectrophotometric surveys at $\sim$6'' spatial resolution in 102 spectral channels spanning 0.75 to 5 $\mu$m. The Simulator software implements models for astrophysical emission, instrument characteristics, and survey strategy to generate realistic infrared sky scenes as they will be observed by SPHEREx. The simulated data includes a variety of realistic noise and systematic effects that are estimated using up-to-date astrophysical measurements and information from pre-launch instrument characterization campaigns. Through the pre-flight mission phases the Simulator has been critical in predicting the impact of various effects on SPHEREx science performance, and has played an important role guiding the development of the SPHEREx data analysis pipeline. In this paper, we describe the \skysim\ architecture, pre-flight instrument and sky models, and summarize high-level predictions from the Simulator, including a pre-launch prediction for the 5$\sigma$ point source sensitivity of SPHEREx, which we estimate to be $m_{\rm AB}$ 18.5--19 from 0.75 to 3.8~$\mu$m and $m_{\rm AB}$ 16.6--18 from 3.8 to 5 $\mu$m, with the sensitivity limited by the zodiacal light background at all wavelengths. In the future, on-orbit data will be used to improve the Simulator, which will form the basis of a variety of forward-modeling tools that will be used to model myriad instrumental and astrophysical processes to characterize their systematic effects on our final data products and analyses.",
Cross submissions,Gravitational Bounce from the Quantum Exclusion Principle,"Enrique Gaztanaga,K. Sravan Kumar,Swaraj Pradhan,Michael Gabler",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We investigate the fully relativistic spherical collapse model of a uniform distribution of mass $M$ with initial comoving radius $\chi_*$ and spatial curvature $k \equiv 1/\chi_k^2 \le 1/\chi_*^2$ representing an over-density or bounded perturbation within a larger background. Our model incorporates a perfect fluid with an evolving equation of state, $P = P(\rho)$, which asymptotically transitions from pressureless dust ($P = 0$) to a ground state characterized by a uniform, time-independent energy density $\rho_{\rm G}$. This transition is motivated by the quantum exclusion principle, which prevents singular collapse, as observed in supernova core-collapse explosions. We analytically demonstrate that this transition induces a gravitational bounce at a radius $R_{\rm B} = (8 \pi G \rho_{\rm G}/3)^{-1/2}$. The bounce leads to an exponential expansion phase, where $P(\rho)$ behaves effectively as an inflation potential. This model provides novel insights into black hole interiors and, when extended to a cosmological setting, predicts a small but non-zero closed spatial curvature: $ -0.07 \pm 0.02 \le \Omega_k < 0$. This lower bound follows from the requirement of $\chi_k \ge \chi_* \simeq 15.9$ Gpc to address the cosmic microwave background low quadrupole anomaly. The bounce remains confined within the initial gravitational radius $r_{\rm S} = 2GM$, which effectively acts as a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ inside $r_{\rm S}=\sqrt{3/\Lambda}$ while still appearing as a Schwarzschild black hole from an external perspective. This framework unifies the origin of inflation and dark energy, with its key observational signature being the presence of small but nonzero spatial curvature, a testable prediction for upcoming cosmological surveys.",

This will enable searches for dark matter and other physics beyond the Standard Model, of which we study four cases: axions, dark photons, dark matter subhalos and neutrino masses. We forecast DSA-2000's potential to detect axions through two mechanisms in neutron star magnetospheres: photon conversion of axion dark matter and radio emission from axion clouds, developing the first analytical treatment of the latter. We also forecast DSA-2000's sensitivity to discover kinetically mixed dark photons from black hole superradiance, constrain dark matter substructure and fifth forces through pulsar timing, and improve cosmological neutrino mass inference through fast radio burst dispersion measurements. Our analysis indicates that in its planned five year run the DSA-2000 could reach sensitivity to QCD axion parameters, improve current limits on compact dark matter by an order of magnitude, and enhance cosmological weak lensing neutrino mass constraints by a factor of three.",

Data from every observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration is typically analyzed in this way twice, first in a low-latency mode in which gravitational wave candidates are identified in near-real time, and later in a high-latency mode. Such high-latency analyses have traditionally been considered more sensitive, since background data from the full observing run is available for assigning significance to all candidates, as well as more robust, since they do not need to worry about keeping up with live data. In this work, we present a novel technique to use the matched filtering data products from a low-latency analysis and re-process them by assigning significances in a high-latency way, effectively removing the need to perform matched filtering a second time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we analyze 38 days of LIGO and Virgo data from the third observing run (O3) using the GstLAL pipeline, and show that our method is as sensitive and reliable as a traditional high-latency analysis. Since matched filtering represents the vast majority of computing time for a traditional analysis, our method greatly reduces the time and computational burden required to produce the same results as a traditional high-latency analysis. Consequently, it has already been adopted by GstLAL for the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration.",
Cross submissions,Can a Dark Inferno Melt Earth's Core?,"Christopher Cappiello,Tansu Daylan",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP),"The search for dark matter is one of the crucial open problems in both particle physics and cosmology. If dark matter scatters with Standard Model particles, it could accumulate inside the Earth and begin to annihilate, producing heat within the Earth's core. While past work has been done on the effect that this heat would have once it reached the surface, we model the flow of heat through the Earth's core by numerically solving the heat equation to model dark matter's effect on the interior of the planet. We compute how long it takes for the core to come into thermal equilibrium and show that for a wide range of dark matter parameters, a substantial fraction of the inner core would be melted by dark matter annihilation. Our analysis produces new limits on dark matter annihilating in the Earth, points out important new effects that must be considered when studying planetary heating by dark matter, and suggests new dark matter observables that could be searched for in exoplanet populations.",
Cross submissions,Covariant diffusion and drift of the stochastic GW background with LISA,"Giorgio Mentasti,Arad Nasiri",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We study the covariant diffusion and drift of massless particles on the light cone within the context of quantum gravity phenomenology. Unlike modified dispersion relations that violate Lorentz invariance and grow with frequency, this model introduces a stochastic correction to the massless geodesic equation while preserving Lorentz invariance, and is dominant at lower frequencies due to the larger spacetime support of long-wavelength modes. The effect is phenomenologically described by just two diffusion and drift parameters, $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, whose values are already constrained by measurements of the CMB blackbody spectrum. We show that a direct measurement and characterization of a gravitational wave (GW) background frequency spectrum can improve bounds on these diffusion and drift parameters by over 12 orders of magnitude compared to those from the CMB. In particular, we find that detecting a GW background sourced by realistic models of first-order phase transitions or primordial black holes (PBH) with LISA can constrain the parameters down to a value of $\kappa_1,\,\kappa_2\lesssim 10^{-56}\,\text{kg}\,\text{m}^2\text{s}^{-3}$.",
Cross submissions,Likelihoods for Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Data Analysis,"Gabriele Franciolini,Mauro Pieroni,Angelo Ricciardone,Joseph D. Romano",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"We present a systematic study of likelihood functions used for Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) searches. By dividing the data into many short segments, one customarily takes advantage of the Central Limit Theorem to justify a Gaussian crosscorrelation likelihood. We show, with a hierarchy of ever more realistic examples, beginning with a single frequency bin and one detector, and then moving to two and three detectors with white and colored signal and noise, that approximating the exact Whittle likelihood by various Gaussian alternatives can induce systematic biases in the estimation of the SGWB parameters. We derive several approximations for the full likelihood and identify regimes where Gaussianity breaks down. We also discuss the possibility of conditioning the full likelihood on fiducial noise estimates to produce unbiased SGWB parameter estimation. We show that for some segment durations and bandwidths, particularly in space-based and pulsar-timing arrays, the bias can exceed the statistical uncertainty. Our results provide practical guidance for segment choice, likelihood selection, and data-compression strategies to ensure robust SGWB inference in current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors.",
